# Cloud Development Environment (CDE)

A CDE is an automated environment accessed directly from a code editor, or sometimes directly in a browser. 

CDEs are used to gain access to greater compute and memory than is available locally when running large tech stacks such as testing integration of microservices, or machine learning. Often, CDEs are used for the security benefits of isolated and temporary environments, and the ability to automate away setup steps and reduce developer cognitive load in addition to managing source code exfiltration risks by removing source code and credentials from developer endpoints and devices. 

They are often automated, and will integrate with the platform code and artifact repositories to pull down all assets that developers need to run their application or workflow. A CDE can be integrated with a platform secrets manager to fetch credentials to provide automated access to platform databases, clusters or shared data. CDEs are commonly integrated into developer portals to support platform organizational platform goals, such as speeding up developer onboarding.
