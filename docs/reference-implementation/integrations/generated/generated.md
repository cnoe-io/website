# Integrations

Part of creating an internal developer platform includes building cohesion
around developer workflows.

With CNCF technologies, most, if not all, developer workflows involve
interacting with Kubernetes as the underlying platform via CRDs and operators.
But also the majority of the work an IDP enables is to tie back the developer
workflow to the underlying infrastructure.

We have build the CNOE CLI to bring tooling to the IDP experience that
streamlines some common developer workflows. This involves tooling that
helps with migrating developer workflows to your developer portal. This also
involves adding verifications and extensions to developer workflows.
