## Using the idpbuilder

### Basic usage

The most basic command which creates a Kubernetes Cluster (Kind cluster) with the core packages installed.

```bash
./idpbuilder create
```

Once idpbuilder finishes provisioning cluster and packages, you can access GUIs by going to the following addresses in your browser.

* ArgoCD: https://argocd.cnoe.localtest.me:8443/
* Gitea: https://gitea.cnoe.localtest.me:8443/

You can obtain credentials for them by running the following command:

```bash
./idpbuilder get secrets
```

  <summary> The "get secrets" command </summary>

The `get secrets` command retrieves the following:
- ArgoCD initial admin password.
- Gitea admin user credentials.
-  Any secrets labeled with `cnoe.io/cli-secret=true`.

You can think of the command as executing the following kubectl commands:

  ```bash
  kubectl -n argocd get secret argocd-initial-admin-secret
  kubectl get secrets -n gitea gitea-admin-secret
  kubectl get secrets -A -l cnoe.io/cli-secret=true
  ```
In addition, secrets labeled with `cnoe.io/package-name` can be specified with the `-p` flag. For example, for Gitea:

  ```bash
  ./idpbuilder get secrets -p gitea
  ```

###  Example commands

**For more advanced use cases, check out the [Stacks Repository](https://github.com/cnoe-io/stacks).**

You can specify the kubernetes version by using the `--kube-version` flag. Supported versions are available [here](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind/releases).

```
./idpbuilder create --kube-version v1.27.3
```

If you want to specify your own kind configuration file, use the `--kind-config` flag.

```
./idpbuilder create --build-name local --kind-config ./my-kind.yaml`
```

If you want to specify ArgoCD configmap.

```
./idpbuilder create --package-custom-file=argocd:path/to/argocd-cm.yaml
```

Run the following commands for available flags and subcommands:

```
./idpbuilder --help
./idpbuilder create --help
```

### Custom Packages

Idpbuilder supports specifying custom packages using the flag `-p` flag. This flag expects a directory (local or remote) containing ArgoCD application files and / or ArgoCD application set files. In case of a remote directory, it must be a directory in a git repository, and the URL format must be a [kustomize remote URL format](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize/blob/master/examples/remoteBuild.md).

Examples of using custom packages are available in the [stacks repository](https://github.com/cnoe-io/stacks). Let's take a look at [this example](https://github.com/cnoe-io/stacks/tree/main/basic). This defines two custom package directories to deploy to the cluster.

To deploy these packages, run the following command:

```
./idpbuilder create \
  -p https://github.com/cnoe-io/stacks//basic/package1 \
  -p https://github.com/cnoe-io/stacks//basic/package2
```

Alternatively, you can use the local directory format.

```bash
# clone the stacks repository
git clone https://github.com/cnoe-io/stacks.git
cd stacks
# run idpbuilder against the local directory
./idpbuilder create \
  -p examples/basic/package1\
  -p examples/basic/package2
```

Running this command should create three additional ArgoCD applications in your cluster.

```sh
$ kubectl get Applications -n argocd  -l example=basic
NAME         SYNC STATUS   HEALTH STATUS
guestbook    Synced        Healthy
guestbook2   Synced        Healthy
my-app       Synced        Healthy
```

Let's break this down. The [first package directory](https://github.com/cnoe-io/stacks/tree/main/basic/package1) defines an application. This corresponds to the `my-app` application above. In this application, we want to deploy manifests from local machine in GitOps way.

The directory contains an [ArgoCD application file](https://github.com/cnoe-io/stacks/blob/main/basic/package1/app.yaml).  This is a normal ArgoCD application file except for one field.

```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Application
spec:
  source:
    repoURL: cnoe://manifests
```

The `cnoe://` prefix in the `repoURL` field indicates that we want to sync from a local directory.
Values after `cnoe://` is treated as a relative path from this file. In this example,
we are instructing idpbuilder to make ArgoCD sync from files in the [manifests directory](https://github.com/cnoe-io/stacks/tree/main/basic/package1/manifests).

As a result the following actions were taken by idpbuilder:
1. Create a Gitea repository.
2. Fill the repository with contents from the manifests directory.
3. Update the Application spec to use the newly created repository.

You can verify this by going to this address in your browser: https://gitea.cnoe.localtest.me:8443/giteaAdmin/idpbuilder-localdev-my-app-manifests

This is the repository that corresponds to the [manifests](https://github.com/cnoe-io/stacks/tree/main/basic/package1/manifests) folder.
It contains a file called `alpine.yaml`, synced from the `manifests` directory above.

You can also view the updated Application spec by going to this address: https://argocd.cnoe.localtest.me:8443/applications/argocd/my-app

The second package directory defines two normal ArgoCD applications referencing a remote repository.
They are applied as-is.
