## About

[cnoe-io/idpbuilder](https://github.com/cnoe-io/idpbuilder)
:::


Spin up a complete internal developer platform using industry standard technologies like Kubernetes, ArgoCD, and Backstage with only Docker required as a dependency.

This can be useful in several ways:
* Create a single binary which can demonstrate an IDP reference implementation.
* Use within CI to perform integration testing.
* Use as a local development environment for IDP engineers.
