# Validation

- Platforms can make use of API specifications and code generation to create validators for client interactions and data exchange. Kubernetes does this with its type system and Open API Spec V3 (at the time of this writing).
- Proper validation ensures that clients of the platform fail quickly and loudly if their requests are malformed or inconsistent with the platform’s API schemas.
- Kubernetes also offers “admission control” as a lifecycle hook on client requests in addition to validation against type schemas. However this type of ad-hoc validation can be implemented within many phases or locations with platform tooling.
- Admission control can also be a common substrate for injecting policy controls or building guardrails within the platform to meet security or regulatory requirements.
- When paired with Cryptographic signing, verification of the signatures on  configurations and artifacts (like container images) can be done with admission control. This allows for the enforcement of policy only allowing verifiably good materials into an environment.
