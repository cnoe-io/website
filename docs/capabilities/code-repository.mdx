# Code Repositories

- Historical lineage of changes to a codebase (think source code for apps and libraries)
- Allows for developers to collaborate on code asynchronously. This includes peer reviews and change request approvals
- Usually centralized even when using decentralized tooling like git. While git and other source control tooling can allow for decentralized collaboration, usually we choose to centralize the common workflows associated with code review and automation driven by git aka “git-ops”.
- When appropriately hardened and durable, pull requests (and associated merges to protected branches) can be used as a “system of record” for change control and approval in regulatory environments.
