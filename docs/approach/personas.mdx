# Personas

### Application Developers
Experts in writing business-logic-specific code to be consumed by “customers”. Familiar with traditional programming languages and frameworks with minimal interest in infrastructure components outside of the ones in-use for their applications.

### Package Builders
Experts in stitching together multiple components into reusable blueprints and delivering those as a service. Package builders are likely to “wrap” multiple infrastructure and application parts into singular deployables that can be leveraged by application developers.

### Infrastructure Operators
Experts in deployment and management of the infrastructure and platform components that provide the foundation to business applications. Familiar with infra-as-code primitives and automation/scripting languages, as well the fundamental characteristics of network, storage, and database. Also likely to have experience with application orchestration platforms and their underlying functionality.

### Information Security Engineers (ISE)
Experts in applying and enforcing security and compliance best practices. ISE’s partner with package builders to approve production ready packages to be used across the organization.
